Here is my math project:https://steven-passynkov.github.io/grade5-project/2.html
The assignment is Choose 3 colours to represent 3 different colours of fish.
Put objects into a container/bag to match these probabilities
The probabilities of picking a yellow fish and a blue fish are the same.
The probabilities of picking a red fish is greater.
